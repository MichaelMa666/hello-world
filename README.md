# hello-world

Today is 2016/4/7 Sunny

I create my own github the other day, but today I start to learn how to write it. I am sorry I always have quizzes deadline.

Uh-huh...

I hope I can keep along this way which about node.js + javascripts + redis to finish my coding life. I hate pointer.

If I can write a program which about showing how to surf the Internet for my Mom. Give the tutorial to her .I will feel satisfied.\(^o^)/~
